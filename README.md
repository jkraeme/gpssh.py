GPSS has a fascinating history, especially considering it was one of the first languages 
to allow people to simulate complex systems without needing to be a hardcore programmer.

The Origins of GPSS
===================
GPSS (General Purpose Simulation System) was invented by Geoffrey Gordon while he was 
working at IBM and it was first released in October 1961.

The Innovation: Before GPSS, simulation usually required writing lengthy, custom code 
in languages like Fortran. Gordon introduced a "block-oriented" approach, where users 
could represent a system (like a bank line or a factory floor) using a flowchart-like structure.

The Evolution: GPSS/H
=====================
As computing power evolved, the original GPSS was seen as somewhat slow because it was an 
interpreted language. This led to the development of GPSS/H, a high-performance version 
that used a compiler to make simulations run significantly faster. It was developed by James 
O. Henriksen and was first released in 1977 by his company, Wolverine Software Corporation.

The Impact: GPSS/H became the industry standard because it was often 10 to 50 times 
faster than the IBM versions of GPSS that preceded it.

James O. Henriksen died on April 6, 2019.  He will be greatly missed by the simulation community.

This Project
============
This is an attempt at allowing new generations of computer scientists, Operations Reseachers, 
business analysts, business students, and historians of computer discrete simulation to 
have the ability to experience this power of James Henriksen's language: GPSS/H
